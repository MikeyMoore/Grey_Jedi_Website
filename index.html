	<h1>The Code of the Grey Jedi</h1>
	<p>This site is dedicated to the grey Jedi.  Many consider the grey Jedi to have abandoned the ways of the Jedi and gone down the path towards the dark side, even going as far as to call them "Dark Jedi".  Others would say they do not deserve the title "Jedi" at all.  While that may be the case, we believe that the code of the Grey Jedi is one that deserves a voice and should not be viewed as evil or sinister in nature.  Instead, set aside all prejudice and assumptions for now while you learn the code of the grey Jedi.  Perhaps you, like us, will find balance here.</p>
